This is the source code of my [website](https://vdavoodnia.github.io/).

This website was possible thanks to below open source projects.

- It is based on a fork of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/)
- Some transition effects from [Jon Barron's](https://github.com/jonbarron/website) repository
- CV template, liquid, and design from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme
- Dark-mode was possible thanks to [VladimirSiv](https://github.com/VladimirSiv/VladimirSiv.github.io) comments on this [issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/discussions/2033)
