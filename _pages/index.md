I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence 
from the [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Machines Laboratory (Aiim Lab)](https://www.aiimlab.com/) at 
[Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/), expecting to graduate in June 2024. My current work lies 
in the intersection of NLP and 3D human pose estimation from cameras and pressure sensors. During my studies, 
I have worked on developing deep-learning methods for pose estimation in smart environments using ubiquitous sensors. 
I recently finished my internship at [LaForge](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/laforge) in [Ubisoft Toronto Inc.](https://toronto.ubisoft.com/), 
designing, developing, and deploying 
a markerless motion capture application, resulting in fast and accurate prototyping in 
outdoor environments. Our research in multi-view pose estimation pushed the academic state of the art and performed 
similarly to industrial competitors.  

Before my Ph.D., I gained diverse experience working at the [Brain Engineering Research Center](https://braineng.scs.ipm.ac.ir/), 
[IPM](https://ipm.ir/ipmic.jsp), while completing my B.Sc. from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), Iran. 
As a software developer, I collaborated with teams of engineers and international research groups 
to create mobile and desktop applications using Python, Matlab, Java, and C++. Furthermore, as a research scientist, 
I published several papers and gained valuable experience in signal processing, data science, and statistics.

<p class="about-me-job">
I am actively seeking opportunities in the industrial, research, and development 
sectors, particularly in roles that allow me to apply my expertise on 
Artificial Intelligence. I am open to discussing potential roles that align with my skills 
and interests, such as research, data science, or AI engineering positions.
